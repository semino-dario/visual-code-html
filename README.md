This is a prototype builded to test the idea of the project of a website with interactive animations that allow the visualization of algorithms behavior under the hood. The code in this first draft was completely generated with Gemini 2.4 Flash, in less than two hours. The real project goes in Next.js with Typescript among other tools, and the code is nearly 100% different. But the idea remains. I keep this first draft as register of the work done.
